# Diabetes Progression Prediction using ANN

This project models the progression of diabetes using an Artificial Neural Network
on the Diabetes dataset available in the sklearn library.

## Key Steps:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ANN model design and training
- Model evaluation using MSE and R² score
- Performance improvement through model tuning
